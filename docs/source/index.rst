Ontologysim: a Owlready2 library for applied production simulation
====================================================================

Ontologysim is an open-source production simulation framework, with an emphasis on modularized flexible library design and straightforward usability for applications in research and practice. Ontologysim is built on top of `Owlready2 framework <https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/>`_ and requires Python >3.7.

Ontologysim follows a set of high-level design choices which differentiate it from other similar libraries:

* the simulation can be saved at any time and started from a defined point
* high degrees of freedom and possibilities due to the ontology
