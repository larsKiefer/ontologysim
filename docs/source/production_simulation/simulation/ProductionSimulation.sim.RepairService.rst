Repair Service Structure
-----------------------------------------------------------

The machine service and transport service are identical. Each service consist of a waiting list, where defect machines are saved and
service places called service operator.

The way how defects are handled:

1. a defect event is created and the defect is saved to the service waiting list
2. the service operator evaluates, which defect is repaired
3. the defect instance gets repaired at a service operator
